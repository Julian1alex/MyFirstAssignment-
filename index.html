                <h2> This is my story </h2>
                <p> Now this is a story all about how
                    My life got flipped-turned upside down
                    And I'd like to take a minute
                    Just sit right there
                    I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel-Air
                    <br>
                    In west Philadelphia born and raised
                    On the playground was where I spent most of my days
                    Chillin' out maxin' relaxin' all cool
                    And all shooting some b-ball outside of the school
                    When a couple of guys who were up to no good
                    Started making trouble in my neighborhood
                    I got in one little fight and my mom got scared
                    She said, "You're movin' with your auntie and uncle in Bel-Air"
                    <br>
                    I begged and pleaded with her day after day
                    But she packed my suitcase and sent me on my way
                    She gave me a kiss and then she gave me my ticket
                    I put my Walkman on and said, "I might as well kick it"
                    <br>
                    First class, yo, this is bad
                    Drinking orange juice out of a champagne glass
                    Is this what the people of Bel-Air living like?
                    Hmm, this might be alright
                    <br>
                    But wait I hear they're prissy, bourgeois, all that
                    Is this the type of place that they just send this cool cat?
                    I don't think so
                    I'll see when I get there
                    I hope they're prepared for the prince of Bel-Air
                    <br>
                    Well, the plane landed and when I came out
                    There was a dude who looked like a cop standing there with my name out
                    I ain't trying to get arrested yet
                    I just got here
                    I sprang with the quickness like lightning, disappeared
                    <br>
                    I whistled for a cab and when it came near
                    The license plate said "Fresh" and it had dice in the mirror
                    If anything I could say that this cab was rare
                    But I thought, "Nah, forget it"
                    â€“ "Yo, home to Bel-Air"
                    <br>
                    I pulled up to the house about 7 or 8
                    And I yelled to the cabbie, "Yo home smell ya later"
                    I looked at my kingdom
                    I was finally there
                    To sit on my throne as the Prince of Bel-Air
